    <p>Hi, my name is Joshua Salanitri and I'm 23 years old from melbourne.</p>
      <p>My Hobbies include playing games and playing soccer. I completed Year 12 in 2016 at Viewbank College and I studied IT in year 11.<br/> I've really felt a growing love for IT in the past 2 or 3 years as I really got into PC gaming and wanted to learn how everything works and want to immerse myself in the world more.</p>
    <p>I love building computers. I've built 8 now (i think), most being quite high end gaming PCs for my friends.<br/> I play indoor soccer with my friends and outdoor soccer for Watsonia Heights FC as an attacking midfielder.<br/>
       With pretty much every other hour of my day I'm playing games with my friends. My favourite games are Destiny 2, Minecraft, Apex Legends, COD and Beat Saber. <br/> <br/> Also this is Ollie.</p>

      <h2 id="Interest">Interest in IT</h2>
      <h4>What is your interest in IT? When did your interest in IT start? Was there a particular event or person that sparked your interest? Outline your IT experience (if any).</h4>
    <p>I've always had an interest in IT , having chosen IT in all electives at high school, but I really started developing my serious interest in IT in the last 1 or 2 years, especially during covid lockdown.<br> My interest at first was purely hardware related, I loved building and tinkering with PCs, after getting unlucky with multiple parts being shipped already broken it developed into some extensive troubleshooting. <br>At that point i started to really enjoy myself while doing anything IT related,<br> to the point where i was going to teach myself how to program in java to try and make minecraft mods and i thought to myself how much i would enjoy a career in IT if it was all i wanted to do in my spare time.</p>
    <h4>Why did you choose to come to RMIT?</h4>
    <p>I chose to come to RMIT/OUA for a number of reasons, I really like the idea of studying from home.<br> It gives me a lot of flexibility to continue living my life without changing too much.<br> Another reason was the RMIT course was specifically recommended to me by a friend who completed the course last year.</p>
    <h4>What do you expect to learn during your studies?</h4>
    <p>I expect to learn a lot of different skills from every aspect of IT. I'm quite excited to learn how to program and learn networking.<br> I'm also looking forward to and expect to learn a lot of skills that will help me get a job, such as planning projects and working with others in groups.</p>

    <h2 id="ijob">ideal job</h2>
    <p>My ideal job in the IT field is probably a software developer.<br> I have identified this carsales job ad as a great example of something I would love to do in the future.</p>
    <p>The job has a wide number of roles and responsibilities that would keep it fresh,<br> like rolling out new features to the website and experience but also maintaining the current software.<br> This is really appealing because it would really annoy me if I got stuck doing one role at a company.<br> IT is such a broad field and I would hate to waste the potential that it has.</p>
    <p>The role is looking for people who have experience in a professional business environment,<br> as well as programmers experienced in C#, .NET and .Net Core as well as experience with AWS, Amazon's cloud service.</p>
    <p>While obviously not having any of that knowledge or experience right now i'm looking forward to finish my studies and gain experience and knowledge in these fields so that one day i can hope to fill a position like this</p>
    <p>To get to a position like that I'm definitely going to have to finish my bachelors in IT here at OUA/RMIT and find a junior developer job,<br> and gain experience in the field while also possibly taking more courses and learning different languages depending on the languages that we learn later in this course.</p>

    <h2 id="profile">Profile</h2>
    <p>After completing the Myers-Briggs test, emtrain learning style test and big 5 personality test, the results didn't surprise me at all.</p>
    <p>My result for the Myers-Briggs test was ‘Virtuoso’. Virtuoso so someone who likes hands-on learning, trial and error and problem solving.<br> Their strengths are that they are optimistic, creative and rational and weaknesses are that they are stubborn and hard to get to know.<br> While the test itself has been scientifically written off, I still find that some of the key points are still quite accurate.</p>
    <p>The next test was the emtrain learning style test. My result here was that my primary learning style was pragmatist with a score of 41%.<br> Good learning methods for pragmatists include practicals, discussion and problem solving relating quite well with my results above.</p>
    <p>The final test I completed was the big 5 personality test where my result was 48% openness, 15% conscientiousness, 69% extraversion, 35% agreeableness and 65% neuroticism.<br> These results I feel this is the least accurate test about me, saying I care more about social achievements and I also think quite negatively about myself.</p>
    <p>The results reflecting my learning and working style are quite positive.<br> The test results stating that I am a very hands-on learner and that I like and am good at problem solving makes me feel very confident I've chosen the right career path.<br> I feel it will really benefit me in my studies as well.</p>
    <p>Scoring high in extraversion and the fact that pragmatists react well with discussion and group work I think this will really help when working with a team. <br> I’m very friendly and like bouncing ideas off other people but I'm also really easily agreeable and I'm happy working on someone else's idea. <br> When forming a team im going to be content with most groups, as i’ll work well with and get along with most people in the course</p>

    <h2 id="project">Project ideas</h2>
    <h4>Overview</h4>
    <p>Powerful items, (working title) is a minecraft mod designed around bringing powerful end game items to minecraft without altering the rest of the game and keeping it still relatively the same,<br> the idea of this mod that for every piece in an armour set and tool/weapon there is a version that is much more powerful than its default variant,<br> and only one of these items can ever exist in the world meaning if you lose one its lost forever.<br> The items can either be crafted or found in the world by exploring.
    </p>
    <h4>Motivation</h4>
    <p>My motivation behind the creation of a mod like this is the lack of pinnacle content in vanilla minecraft,<br> sure there are mods with very powerful items but these are always part of much larger mod packs which complicate the game to become a very different experience.<br> Whereas in my case here, the mod is very simple, down to earth does not alter the main start and mid game of minecraft.<br> Another motivation for myself is I've always wanted to make my own minecraft mod,<br> it's one of the reasons I was interested in doing this course in the first place.</p>
    <h4>Description</h4>
    <p>Powerful items will add 1 new helmet, chest, leg and boot armour to the game, they will do things that relate to the piece for example the helmet will let you breathe infinitely under water, the chest will add the elytra (gliding) function to your chest piece while still having protection, the legs will improve your movement like the ability run faster, jump higher and the boots will mitigate all fall damage. These are all rough drafts of the ideas I've had for making stronger armour pieces. 
      For weapons and tools there will be a sword, pickaxe, axe, shovel and hoe. The ideas for these items are that the axe will cut down entire trees after you destroy one block, the pickaxes will mine the entire vein of an ore and also smelt them. For the hoe, for every 1000 crops you farm it increases your percentage chance to get a second drop maxing out at 100% at 100,000 crops. The sword will have an ability where it will teleport you directly behind an enemy, this won't work on players and the shovel will have a block reach of 50 blocks.
      </p>
    <p>Helmet- The ability to infinitely breathe underwater earned by finding it in the bottom of a underwater temple in a chest where it has a random chance to spawn in (maybe 20% or something)<br><br>
      Chest - Has an elytra attached to it for flight earned by crafting it with a netherite chest plate and 8 elytras, this is less of a chance and more or a targeted grind to remove RNG from the item as the elytra is essential in late game vanilla.<br><br>
      Legs - gives 200% speed and a 3 block high jump boost, quite simple and really useful for improved movement, these are found in shipwrecks, as shipwrecks are quite common the chances of finding one in a chest will be quite low at about 2-3%<br><br>
      Boots - negate fall damage, nice and simple and the ability to walk on lava, this will be found at the bottom of desert temples as you need to drop down quite a deep hole to get the chests and again as temples are quite common they will have a spawn chance of 5%
      </p>
    <p>sword - crafted with 2 dragon eggs, and will teleport you behind the nearest mob within 20 blocks.<br><br>
      The pickaxe - found in mineshaft chests, will mine all connected blocks of all ores as well as smelt ones that can be smelted.<br><br>
      The axe - found in a woodland mansion, cuts an entire tree down by destroying the bottom block<br><br>
      The hoe - found in chests in villages will increase the chance to drop 2 crops every 1000 crops you farm maxing out at 100% at 100,000 crops.<br><br>
      the shovel - earned from a 30% chance to drop from killing the wither, behaves like a netherite shovel except it has a reach of 50 blocks<br><br>
      </p>   
    <h4>Tools and technologies</h4>   
    <p>As i haven't coded with java before i would have to stick with basic tutorials at first,<br> Minecraft mods are quite popular and therefore there's quite a lot of easy to understand basic tutorials out there.<br> While they're there to help you find your feet with modding and java I wouldn't want to stick to them that closely,<br> and try to develop my own skills while learning the language at the same time. You also need a minecraft mod loader like forge,<br> and a 2D styling app like pinta or paint.</p>
    <h4>Skills</h4>  
    <p>The skills i and my group will have to learn is how to code in java mainly,<br> as the intro to programming course starts with python, that's all i have experience with, so learning a second language is necassary.<br> Also learning how to have multiple people working at the same time through github will be a great experience.<br> Aswell as writing the code another challenge will be transferring the asset in game.<br> Finally, creating some artwork for our assets while not being very difficult in itself, getting the art to actually look good and where we want to,<br> may prove more difficult than first thought.</p>
    <h4>Outcome</h4>
    <p>If or when completed, the mod i think will fill a nice hole that minecraft has in the late game,<br> providing something for players to chase in the background of late game, while not being the main objective, <br>it's just something to be worked on in the background and something to encourage exploring. <br> The idea is not to take over the game or change the way anyone plays it until quite late game where these items are better than the tools they've already spent hours working on acquiring.</p>
